# Neetcode Blind 75 Solutions
My public space for learning algorithm and data structure on [Neetcode Blind 75.](https://neetcode.io/practice)

I learn by watching the explanation video without the code implementation and by trying to implement it myself. When I am stuck or finished with my own code implementation, I see the code solution in the video and/or the given code in the page. Then, I try to code to the solution again off top of my head. I repeat these steps until I get it right.

I am also learning new languages concurently. The languages that I have used so far are Go, Rust, and Java.

I use a ChatGPT bot on Poe.com to assist me in solving these problems. The bot I use is [this dsalgobot.](https://poe.com/dsalgobot)
